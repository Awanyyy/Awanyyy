Hi there, I'm Misaka ðŸ‘‹

I'm a grad student at Tianjin University (TJU), diving deep into the world of 3D Reconstruction.

While my academic quest is to rebuild the world in 3D reconstruction, I'm also a passionate backend developer exploring the logic behind the digital worldâ€”with Java as my current favorite tool.

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to chat with me about Java, 3D reconstruction, or anything in between!

ðŸ“« You can reach me via email: 1746921826@qq.com
